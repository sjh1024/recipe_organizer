ingredients:
2.5 pounds potatoes
2 cloves garlic, minced
4 tbsp butter
1/2 cup milk
Salt
instructions:
Peel potatoes if you don't want skins in your mashed potatoes.
Cut potatoes into evenly sized chunks, about an inch thick; transfer into large stockpot full of cold water. Make sure water line is about 1 inch above the potatoes.
Stir the garlic and 1/2 tablespoon of salt into the water. Heat the potatoes over high heat until the water comes to a boil.
Reduce heat to medium-high (or whatever temperature is needed to maintain the boil) and continue cooking for 10-12 minutes OR until a knife inserted into the middle of a potato chunk goes in easily with almost no resistance. 
Drain the potatoes.
Prepare melted butter mixture: heat butter, milk, and 1 tsp of salt in the microwave until the butter is just melted. Set aside.
Return potatoes to the hot stockpot and place it back on the stove over low heat. Shake the stockpot gently on the burner for about 1 minute to help cook off some of the remaining steam within the potatoes.
Remove stockpot from heat; set on a flat, heatproof surface.
Mash the potatoes to your desired consistency using a potato masher. DO NOT OVERMASH, this will make the potatoes starchy and gluey.
Gradually fold in the melted butter mixture until the potatoes have soaked up the liquid. Fold until just combined to avoid over-mixing.
Taste the potatoes and add salt and pepper to taste.
Serve warm.
