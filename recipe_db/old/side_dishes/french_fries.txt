ingredients:
1. 4 Russet potatoes
2. Cornstarch
3. Salt
4. Oil for frying
instructions:
1. Peel potatoes if you don't want skins on your fries.
2. Cut potatoes lengthwise into desired fry shapes. The thinner the fries are, the crunchier they will get; thicker fries will have a crispy outside and soft inside. 
3. Transfer potatoes into large bowl with enough cold water to submerge the potatoes; let sit for 30 minutes.
4. Carefully drain the water from the potatoes; rinse a few times to remove any extra starch.
5. Place potatoes in a large pot with fresh, lightly salted water, enough to cover 1 inch above the potatoes.
5. Heat the potatoes over high heat until boiling; AS SOON AS IT BOILS, start a timer for 5 minutes, then maintain the boil over medium-high heat. It's not required to fully cook the potatoes, we are just parboiling them to make them extra crispy after frying.
6. Remove potatoes from heat and drain carefully. Spread the cooked potato sticks onto paper towels to pat them dry.
7. Fill a large plate or baking sheet with cornstarch, then roll the fries in the cornstarch to create a thin coating. Set aside.
8. In a deep fryer OR heavy bottomed, high-walled pot, heat oil to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. 
9. Carefully add the fries in batches into the hot oil to avoid overcrowding. Cook each batch for about 5-8 minutes, or until the potatoes are fully cooked and the outside layer scrunches up a bit and turns white. Remove the fries and allow to drain on a paper towel.
10. Wait for the fries to cool down until they are able to be handled by bare hands, about 5-10 minutes.
11. Reheat the oil to 375 degrees Fahrenheit, then repeat the process of frying the potatoes a second time, this time for 4-6 minutes or until golden brown.
12. Remove fries from oil, then toss in salt to taste.
13. Serve warm.
