servings: 2
food_groups: starch, dairy, protein
cuisine: American
flavors:buffalo sauce, spicy, cheese, toasted, savory, salty
ingredients:
Butter
4 slices of sourdough
1 chicken breast (8oz), diced  
½ tsp Garlic Powder
¼ tsp Onion Powder
⅛-¼ tsp Cayenne Pepper
⅛ tsp Paprika
½ tsp Chili Powder
½ tsp Salt
¼ tsp Black Pepper
¼ cup Buffalo Sauce
4 slices of Pepperjack Cheese
Blue Cheese Crumbles
instructions:
Spread butter on both sides of the sourdough slices, then toast lightly in a heated pan. Set aside on a plate.
Add diced chicken, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne, paprika, chili powder, salt, and pepper to a bowl and mix well.
Melt enough butter to lightly coat the bottom of a medium frying pan, then add seasoned chicken to the pan. Cook chicken thoroughly.
Remove chicken from heat and toss in buffalo sauce. Divide chicken in half, and place each portion of chicken on its own slice of sourdough.
Put 2 slices of Pepperjack Cheese and a sprinkle of blue cheese crumbles onto each chicken-covered slice of bread. Close each sandwich with the remaining slices of bread.
Melt enough butter to lightly coat the bottom of a large frying pan, then carefully place the sandwiches onto the pan over medium heat. Press with a spatula.
Cover for 1 minute, then flip the sandwiches with a spatula. Repeat this process until the sandwiches are melted/toasted to your liking. Chicken and cheese may fall out of the sandwich; this is okay, you can add it back to the sandwich later.
Serve warm.
